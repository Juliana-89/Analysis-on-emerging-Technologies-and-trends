# Analysis-on-emerging-Technologies-and-trends

The **Analysis on emerging Technologies and trends** is a capstone project for the **IBM Analytics Professional Certificate** on Coursera. 

## Executive Summary

To remain competitive within the global IT industry, it is crucial to stay abreast of the rapidly evolving technologies. This report employs data analytics to identify current and anticipated trends in the demand for skills associated with programming languages, databases, and other technological areas. It also examines the demographic characteristics of professionals within the tech sector.

Data was obtained from a Stack Overflow survey, IBM's website, and job postings on GitHub. This data was then collected, cleaned, analyzed through exploratory methods, and presented visually on dashboards.

The results indicated that JavaScript is currently the most widely used programming language. Conversely, Python has gained popularity among programmers. At present, Amazon Web Services is the most utilized database, but PostgreSQL is expected to see an increase in demand in the future.

Moreover, most of the survey participants are from the United States, hold a Bachelor's degree, and are between the ages of 25 and 34.

## Introduction

This presentation report employs data analytics to emphasize current and anticipated trends regarding the demand for skills associated with programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks. The following questions were explored using the data:  

1. Which programming languages have the highest demand today?  

2. What database skills are most sought after?  

3. What are the trending IDEs or web frameworks?  

The intended audience for this research includes IT professionals, HR managers, and anyone interested in the IT industry who seeks to understand the most in-demand IT skills in their fields that will remain relevant in the future.

### Findings and Implications

#### Findings

* Currently, the five most widely used databases are Amazon Web Services (AWS), PostgreSQL, MySQL, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

* However, MongoDB and Redis are anticipated to gain popularity in the future.

#### Implications

* SQL remains a key tool for data specialists. 

* Companies continue to favor open-source databases. 

* Oracle SQL, however, has fallen out of the top five and is losing relevance over time.
